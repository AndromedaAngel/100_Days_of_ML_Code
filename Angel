Day 3,
For the perceptron, here's some great resources:

Textbooks:
The Elements of Statistical Learning, Section 4.5.1
Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory To Algorithms, Section 21.4

Blogs:
Jason Brownlee’s article on his Machine Learning Mastery blog, How To Implement The Perceptron Algorithm From Scratch In Python

Sebastian Raschka’s blog post, Single-Layer Neural Networks and Gradient Descent
Videos:
Perceptron Training
How the Perceptron Algorithm Works


Conclusion
Writing an algorithm from scratch can be a very rewarding experience. It’s a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the model, while building an impressive portfolio project at the same time.

Remember to take it slow, and start with something simple. Most importantly, make sure to document and share your work.
